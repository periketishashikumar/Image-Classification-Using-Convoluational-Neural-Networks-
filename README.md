# What does the project do 
The main goal is to recognize the cat and dog image patterns and  classifiying the images of dogs and cats based on the image patterns which 
we learned the image patterns using Convoluational Neural Networks.
# Why the project is useful
It is the first and basic step to learn to build a model which recognize images and based on that patterns classifying those patterns 
from other images.This is the best and basic way to learn how to read the image patterns and how can we work with those patterns.
